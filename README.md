This web application combines aesthetics, responsiveness, and user-friendliness to create an engaging user experience. It is made completely using the Django Framework. It features a sleek and visually appealing design, ensuring that users have an enjoyable interaction regardless of the device they use. Existing Users can log in and new ones can sign in. The centrepiece of the app is its robust Calendar Booking System. Students can effortlessly schedule and manage their lectures, providing them with a convenient way to organise their academic commitments. Students can also view their attendance , assignments due , and some motivational quotes. On the other hand, teachers have a dedicated view that allows them to monitor booked lectures efficiently. The app's functionality is intuitive and user-friendly, with an emphasis on a seamless booking process. While this simplified version does not include a login or authentication system, it offers a glimpse of a practical tool that can be further enhanced for educational institutions, making lecture scheduling and management efficient and hassle-free.

Libraries Used in the Website:

1)FullCalendar:

FullCalendar is a JavaScript library used for creating and managing interactive event calendars.
	In my code, I imported FullCalendar and its related plugins (dayGridPlugin and interactionPlugin) using ES6 module syntax. This allows me to access and use FullCalendar's functionality in the script. I can display the calendar in month form or week form.New Lectures can be booked by the button “Book Lecture” . Two Lectures cannot coincide unless different teachers are teaching them. Each Subject and Teacher is colour coded for ease in finding Lectures. The Lectures can be dragged and dropped and edited. 

2) jQuery:

jQuery is a JavaScript library that simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling.
In my code, I included jQuery to facilitate DOM manipulation. It's primarily used for selecting and interacting with HTML elements.
	For example, I used jQuery to select and retrieve values from input fields when the user submits the event form. Additionally, I used it to handle click events, such as when the "Book Lecture" button is clicked.

3) jQuery UI:

jQuery UI is an extension of jQuery that provides additional user interface interactions and widgets.
	In the code, I included jQuery UI to utilise its features for enhancing the user interface.
	While the specific jQuery UI interactions and widgets are not extensively used in this code, it is included for potential future enhancements or interactions, such as date pickers or other UI elements.

4) Chart.Js:
	It is a JavaScript library that allows you to create interactive and customisable charts and 		graphs for your web applications. It's commonly used for visualising data in various 			formats such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and more. 
		I have used Chart Js to render a pie chart , this represents attendance for each 			month. Red represent Absent , Blue Represents Holiday , Green represents Present , As 		denoted by the legend.
